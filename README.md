# **FurSpot**

A Milestone Project completed by Shell George for the Code Institute Diploma in Software Development.

This would be my second project that I have completed, and I will be submitting for my Milestone project for the Code Institute. This project was inspired by BuzzFeed quizzes to pass time.

# User Experience Design

## **Strategy**  

### **User Needs & Objectives**

 **Focus:** FurSpot was created with intention of easing boredom during the lockdown. I wanted to bring the vibe of a BuzzFeed style quiz this site; and allow users to figure their knowledge levels of pop culture in an interactive manner. I pictured a website where people could to go to on a video call and take part in fun quiz.

 **Definition:** The website will display images of some pets with their owner's either blurred out or cropped out of the image. The users will then have list of celebrities to choose from to guess the pet's correct owner.  

 **Value:** The website was developed so that the users will have somewhere to partake in a fun and interactive quiz. They will also be able to compare scores with their peers and have bragging rights over who amongst their group has the most knowledge on pop culture.

## **Scope**

### Functional Specification

This section is split up into two separate segments for the Owner and the User. By taking the time to understand what features were essential and beneficial for the user; it allowed me to prioritize what features were important and what would just been a 'nice finishing touch' for the user experience and the project.

**Owner Goals:**

- Easy to Navigate
- Simple and interactive web pages.
- Provide an educational opportunity where user learn about random facts about the pets and their owners.
- Have user share the site with friends, which mean they would return to the site. This would also mean regular users on the site.

**User Goals:**

First time user

- Be able to use the site and move through different pages intuitively.
- Participate in quiz and gain some scores at the end of it, to ease boredom.
- Learn about the celebrities and their pets.
- Be able to access the site through various devices.
- Be able to get feedback on whether the question was answered correctly.

Regular or returning user

- Be able to return and try again in the quiz, multiple times and compare scores.
- Be able to share the site easily with friends and compete against them.
- Compare scores against friends.

## **Deployment**

This project was developed on [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/).

Once this was done a repository was made in GitHub. This then allowed me to publish a live site for my project. I followed this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) to ensure that this was done correctly.

**Steps to deploy page from a GitHub repository:**

1. Navigate to your Repository section, select the Repository you want to deploy.
2. Look for the 'Settings' option in Menu bar, and click this to view additional settings.
3. Under the settings page, locate the **Pages** section in the sidebar.
4. Under Source, select the 'None'' button and change it to Master and click Save.
5. Once the page is live you will see the following message "Your site is ready to be published at (Link to the GitHub Live Page)". This is the Link you would need to use to submit your Milestone project.

**How to fork this repository:**

1. Log into GitHub with your account.
2. Locate my repo for this project.
3. On the right side of the screen locate the 'Fork' button and click it.
4. This gives the option to create a copy in your own repository and make changes using GitPod.
5. Once you have finished with changes 'add, commit and push' to your own GitHub.
6. Click Pull Requests and select 'New Pull Request' button.

**How to clone this project to run it locally:**

1. Navigate to the GitHub Repository.
2. Above the files click the green Download Code link.
3. To clone using HTTPS click the clipboard symbol under 'Clone with HTTPS'.
     - To clone using SSH key click Use SSH then click the clipboard symbol.
     - To clone using GitHub CLI select Use GitHub CLI and click the clipboard symbol.
4. Open Terminal on you computer.
5. Change the working directory to the location you want the cloned directory to be.
6. Type 'git clone' and paste the url copied from step 3.
7. Press 'enter' to create your clone.

## **Version Control**

The project was cloned from a template provided by the code institute. Once this was completed git command were used on the terminal on GitPod to ensure changes were saved and backed up. 

**Steps to save you project:**

- Click ***cmd+S*** (macOS users) or ***ctrl+S*** (Windows users) in your IDE.
- In your terminal type in ***git add [name_of_your_file]***.
- You can use your working tree in your IDE to confirm all the changes that had been made.
- Now type ***git commit -m 'short message summarizing the changes'***.
- Finally type ***git push*** to ensure that all changes are synced to 'origin/master' branch.
